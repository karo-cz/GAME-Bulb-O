# GAME-Bulb-O

The game Bulb-o is the first project I've made during the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp, after just 2 weeks into learning. The idea for the game came from an existing one called OnOff.  The main features of this platformer are collisions and physics (gravity). 
Bulb-o was built in JavaScript with the P5.js library.

To do's:
* add more levels
* review the collision code to add different shapes of platforms
* implement the end - winning the game
